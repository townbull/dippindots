# DippinDots

These are my personal (OSX) dotfiles. Please feel free to use/modify them as
you like!

Before you begin, you should have XCode and the XCode Command Line Tools
installed.

You should also have your Github SSH keys (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`) in
`~/.ssh/` so login-less (SSH) Github access can be setup.

## Usage ##
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ftzeng/dippindots.git ~/.dippindots &&
./dippindots.sh
```

Credit for the foundation of these dotfiles goes to:

* [Ben Alman](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles)
